==================
Welcome to GLAMkit
==================

GLAMkit is a free, open source Web framework built on top of Django, specifically for the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) sector. 

It's not just a grab bag of useful plug-and-play Django apps (although it comes with a few of those), but rather a set of tools, patterns and Django base classes which can be extended to produce a bespoke CMS for your cultural institution.

The framework is made up of loosely-coupled :doc:`components <components>`, most of which can be be used a standalone apps, or as part of a larger GLAMkit ecosystem. Our loosely-coupled design approach makes it easy to integrate GLAMkit functionality into existing DJango sites.

GLAMkit is currently in alpha development - sign up `here <http://groups.google.com/group/glamkit-announce>_` to receive announcements about progress. We are still in the process of generalising existing code - so you can expect GLAMkit to grow very quickly over the next few weeks as we plunder our storehouse of code, which represents years of experience and hundreds of hours designing and building GLAM-specific sites. We'd love you to join in on `Github <http://github.com/glamkit>_` or the `mailing list <http://http://groups.google.com/group/glamkit-developers>_`.

However, we should stress that it *is* alpha code. There are still some holes, but there are already several production-ready components that could save a lot of development time, particularly if you're already an experienced Django developer.
