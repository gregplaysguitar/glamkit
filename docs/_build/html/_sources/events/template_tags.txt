====================
Useful Template Tags
====================

All of the templatetags are located in templatetags/scheduletags.py. You can look at more of them there. I am only going to talk about a few here.

To load the template tags this must be in your template

``{% load scheduletags %}``

``querystring_for_date``
------------------------

Usage
    ``{% querystring_for_date <date>[ <num>] %}``

This template tag produces a querystring that describes ``date``.  It turns date into a dictionary and then turns that dictionary into a querystring, in this fashion:

>>> date = datetime.datetime(2009,4,1)
>>> querystring_for_date(date)
'?year=2009&month=4&day=1&hour=0&minute=0&second=0'

This is useful when creating links as the calendar_by_period view uses this to display any date besides ``datetime.datetime.now()``.  The ``num`` argument can be used to say how specific you want to be about the date.  If you were displaying a yearly calendar you only care about the year so ``num`` would only have to be ``1``. See the examples below

>>> querystring_for_date(date, num=1)
'?year=2009'
>>> # Now if we only need the month
>>> querystring_for_date(date, num=2)
'?year=2009&month=4'
>>> # Now everything except the seconds
>>> querystring_for_date(date, num=5)
'?year=2009&month=4&day=1&hour=0&minute=0'
